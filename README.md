The idea is to show some **Next Generation JavaScript** stuff working and how to implement it.

We'll work around with topics like:
- **Class** (props, methods and inheritance),
- **Array** (filter, map and others)
- **Arrow** function
- **Rest operator** 
- **Spread operator**
- And more..

Let me know if you have any suggestion or pull request to it!
